# AI Crew Suite for Spotify Backstage IDP - Actions

![AI Crew Suite core plugins splash image](./ai-crew-suite-social-share-actions.jpeg)

AI Crew Suite is a Backstage plugin workspace for building retrieval-augmented, tool-using AI agents inside a developer portal. This repo includes common GitHub Actions to use in all project repos for CI/CD.

> [!WARNING]
> This repo is pre-beta and under going heavy development as of October, 2026. We are refactoring from LangGraph to a fluent API for workflows in agentic plugins based on Temporal + Mem0 Vercel AI SDK.

## 🏗️ Development Workflow

This repository is a Backstage monorepo using Yarn 4 Plug'n'Play, Turbo, TypeScript project references, and package-local plugin builds.

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js `>=22.22.2`
- Yarn `4.17.1`, as declared by `packageManager`

### 1. Installation & Builds

Run installation routines and build compilation tracks directly from the monorepo root so Yarn PnP and workspace references resolve correctly:

```bash
# optional refresh flag forces full install if wanted
yarn install --refresh
yarn turbo run build
```

### 2. Running Unit & Integration Tests

```bash
yarn turbo run lint
yarn turbo run test
```

### 3. Run Scripts in a Single Package

Add a `--filter`  flag to the command:

```bash
yarn turbo run test --filter=@ai-crew-suite/automate-stale
```

## 📚 Documentation

When adding or changing a core backend module, update the matching package README and the relevant page in the [documentation site repo](https://github.com/ai-crew-suite/documentation).

## 🚀 Release & Publication Management

### Publish a New Version

```bash
yarn turbo run publish
```

- Proxies `yarn changeset publish` to orchestrate multi-package version increments.
- Integrates seamlessly with the npm/Yarn lifecycle hooks (`prepack` / `postpack`) declared inside individual frontend and backend plugins, ensuring distribution tarballs carry fully compiled, production-ready path definitions during registry deployment passes.

### Force a Tag Version

```bash
# 1. Force move local v1 tag to your current commit
git tag -f v1

# 2. Force push the updated tag to GitHub
git push origin v1 -f
```
