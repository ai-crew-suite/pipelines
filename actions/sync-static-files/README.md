# Static File Synchronization Action

> [!WARNING]
> This action is private to the `foundry` repository and is not intended to be used in other AI Crew Suite repositories. It provides centralized management of project markdown, dotfiles, and other static files across the organization.

This action reads a `sync.ts` file from a designated infrastructure directory and provisions exactly one automated Pull Request per downstream target repository for the files grouped under that directory's `src` folder.

## Overview

This GitHub Action serves as an automated platform alignment engineer within the organization. Built as an advanced TypeScript compilation runner (`node20`), it parses a local synchronization matrix (`sync.ts`), dynamically maps files from a centralized source folder (`src`), and distributes upstream infrastructure updates across a multi-repository network by automatically provisioning and updating isolated maintenance branches.

## Core Responsibilities

- **Dynamic Matrix Parsing**: Inspects a designated structural `sync.ts` manifest file to evaluate target repositories, whitespace/newline-separated distribution rules, and intentional file mapping pathways.
- **Upstream Asset Resolution**: Streams and isolates modifications directly from the infrastructure directory's `src` folder to map source configurations to specific target destinations.
- **Automated Branch Governance**: Generates a reusable, dedicated `maintenance/<source-repository>` branch per target repository, maintaining state by executing updates via force-pushing and updating active Pull Requests.

## Architectural Dependency Tree

This action manages structural framework parity and code layout governance across the workspace network:

- **Upstream Engine**: Hooks into native GitHub runner parameters and leverages an elevated Personal Access Token (`GH_PAT`) to execute cross-repository read, write, commit, and Pull Request lifecycle tasks.
- **Downstream Consumer**: Executed directly inside verification pipelines (`.github/workflows/framework-sync.yml`) to automatically enforce universal file alignment across target downstream destinations.
- **Boundary Rule**: Always consume this action utilizing its verified, organization-relative subpath (`ai-crew-suite/pipelines/actions/sync-static-files@v1`). Do not configure isolated or un-managed local file distribution templates.

## Usage

To apply this automated sync auditing layer inside a framework repository layout, integrate the action block using this format:

### Configure the Action Target

Ensure your runner environment provides an explicit `GH_PAT` token and restricts executions to active workflow schedules or localized pipeline triggers:

```yaml
name: Static File Sync

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 1' # Runs every Monday at midnight

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  audit-alignment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: 📂 Checkout Repository Codebase
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: 🔍 Sync Static Infrastructure Files
        uses: ai-crew-suite/pipelines/actions/sync-static-files@v1
        with:
          static_files_path: "static-repo-files-sync"
          GH_PAT: ${{ secrets.GLOBAL_INFRA_PAT }}
          PR_LABELS: "infrastructure, automated-sync"
```

## Parameter Integration Matrix

Ensure your environment states satisfy the required execution properties:

- **`GH_PAT` Provisioning**: Must be explicitly declared as a secret and map to a token possessing read and write scopes for all downstream target repositories and pull requests.
- **Matrix Schema Integrity**: The `sync.ts` architecture must default-export an object whose values are arrays containing `repos` (whitespace or newline-separated) and matching `files` layout arrays:

```typescript
export default {
  default: [
    {
      name: 'Common Files',
      repos: `
        ai-crew-suite/pipelines
        ai-crew-suite/infra
      `,
      files: [
        { source: 'templates/.gitignore', dest: '.gitignore' },
      ],
    },
  ],
};
```

- **Automated Code Delivery**: Sources are evaluated relative to the local `src` folder. Downstream consumers will receive exactly one structured commit and a single, updatable Pull Request targeting a reusable branch layout.

### Action Inputs Configuration

| Name | Required | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `static_files_path` | **Yes** | *None* | Directory containing the infrastructure `src/` and its tracking `sync.ts`. |
| `GH_PAT` | **Yes** | *None* | Privileged Token that can read and write the target repositories and pull requests. |
| `PR_LABELS` | No | `sync` | Comma- or newline-separated pull request labels applied to generated PRs. |

## Local Development Workflow

### Installation & Distribution

This is a JavaScript-backed runtime action compiled using standard toolchain scripts. Verify underlying TypeScript source code layers, dependencies, and formatting before compiling code to `dist/index.js`:

```bash
yarn install --refresh
yarn turbo run build --filter=@ai-crew-suite/action-sync-static-files
```

### Testing Configuration Updates

Execute validation testing frameworks against local mocks before merging updates into the primary release branch:

```bash
yarn turbo run test --filter=@ai-crew-suite/action-sync-static-files
```
